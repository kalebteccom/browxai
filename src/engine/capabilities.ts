// Per-engine capability declarations — the ENGINE dimension that composes with
// the per-tool capability system in util/capabilities.ts. An adapter declares
// which port sub-interfaces it implements and whether it exposes the `Deep`
// (raw-CDP) escape hatch; the per-tool gate consults this to refuse a CDP-hard
// tool on an engine that can't run it.
//
// Chromium declares EVERYTHING — every sub-interface plus `deep` — so no tool
// is newly gated; that is what makes the chromium path byte-identical.
// Firefox declares the cross-browser sub-interfaces but `deep: false`: the
// Juggler build over Playwright has no raw-CDP escape hatch (`newCDPSession`
// throws on Firefox — measured), so the ~19 CDP-hard tools
// structured-refuse on it. WebKit is the same shape — all nine cross-
// browser sub-interfaces, `deep: false` (WebKit has no CDP at all — measured:
// `newCDPSession` throws "CDP session is only available in Chromium"). Android
// is the standout: it IS Chromium (attached over adb + CDP), so it declares
// `deep: true` like desktop Chromium — every tool, including the CDP-deep ones,
// works, and no new substrate is needed (the CDP substrates serve it verbatim).
